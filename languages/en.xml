<serverrules>
  <title>Server Rules</title>
  <intro>
    Failure to comply with these rules will result in appropriate sanctions by the Administrator or Operator in charge.
    The rules, beginning with the mother of all rules — COMMON SENSE — are as follows:
  </intro>
  <text>
  ⚔️ The use of BOTS (programs that play for the user) is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. Punishment: PERMANENT BAN for the account detected and ALL RELATED ACCOUNTS.

  💀 It is strictly forbidden to use the command /dnd while mephing or pindle-running. Why? To avoid issues in case of bot-related sanctions.

  🗡️ It is forbidden to insult, discriminate or provoke other players in any way (religion, race, etc.). Misconduct or harassment will result in penalties.

  🔊 CAPS LOCK (writing in all caps) and FLOODING (repetition of words or phrases) are forbidden. Sanctions will be determined by the Admin or Operator.

  🕸️ Account theft is considered the WORST offense. If committed by a clan member, all accounts within that clan may be permanently banned (including IP ranges).

  🚫 SPAM or advertising of other servers, communities or forums is NOT allowed. Violation results in a permanent ban.

  🔞 Sharing external websites is FORBIDDEN, especially those with adult or violent content. The server is not responsible for third-party links.

  👿 Creating accounts similar to Admin/Op names with malicious intent will be sanctioned according to severity.

  ⚔️ PK (Player Kill) in Softcore is allowed only in “PK Duel” games.
  💀 PK in Hardcore is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.

  💰 Items dropped in public games belong to whoever picks them up. The same applies to gold — it is not penalized but morally discouraged.

  🔥 “Forge Rush” agreements between players are private deals. The Staff will NOT intervene.

  🔐 Staff will NOT change passwords except in verified theft cases. Users are responsible for their own password security.

  💸 Selling items, runes, or accounts for real money is FORBIDDEN. Both buyer and seller will be permanently locked.

  🧙‍♂️ Staff members NEVER need your password. Never share it with anyone. Any losses will be your responsibility.

  ⚰️ Any infraction committed by a clan member may result in sanctions for the entire clan.

  🔥 D2 Revenge reserves the right of admission and permanence.
